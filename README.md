# Web-Design-II-Project-1

This website was created for a fictional client, Murphy's Auto. 
What I enjoyed most about this project was that it taught me the basic design process for creating a website for a customer. 
We learned the importance of creating storyboards to help visualize the final product. 
I learned how to emphatize with the needs of a business in order to create an attractice site to promote their products. 

The technologies used for this site were: CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap 4.
